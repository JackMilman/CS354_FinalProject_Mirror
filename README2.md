Current State of Code:
After checkpoint 1, our robot was able to randomly navigate around the map and return back to the initial pose, but was not able to locate and navigate to victims. Since then, our robot still navigates to randomly generated points, but scans for victims while doing so. Once the robot sees a victim, it calculates and stores the victims location within the map coordinte frame and the victim is given a victim id, it then naviagates to a position in front of that victim, turns to face the victim and takes a close up photo of the victim name tag. Once a victim is located and kept track of, the robot randomly generates a new point to naviagate to and this whole process repeats. Once time is up, the robot naviagtes back the the starting position.
Testing Instructions:
To run our code, you need to clone all of the packages into src, then cd into dev_ws and do colcon build --symlink-install, then source install/setup.bash. Then in one terminal you run "ros2 launch zeta_competition sim.launch.py", "ros2 launch zeta_competition competition.launch.py" in another, and "ros2 launch zeta_rescue rescue.launch.py" in another to run our code.
Goal:
Currently, we are searching for victim by selecting a random point on the map and scanning for victims while naviagting there. Although this approach works, we would like to implement a more efficient searching method that allows our robot to locate all of the victims in less time.
